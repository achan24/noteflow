# NoteFlow TDD Gameplan

## 1. Project Setup
- Scaffold React Native project
- Set up TypeScript
- Add testing frameworks:
  - Unit/Integration: Jest, React Native Testing Library
  - E2E: Detox
- Configure CI to run tests on every push

## 2. TDD Principles
- Red-Green-Refactor:
  1. Write a failing test (Red)
  2. Implement just enough code to pass (Green)
  3. Refactor (Refactor)
- Write tests before all new features and bug fixes
- Cover core logic, UI components, integration
- High coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests

## 3. Development Roadmap (TDD for each step)

### A. Core Data Models & Storage
1. Define models: Video, MusicTrack, Slice, Note, Bookmark, Tag, Transcript, Analytics
2. Write tests for model creation, validation, CRUD
3. Implement storage layer, ensure tests pass

### B. Playlist Management
1. Write tests for playlist CRUD, tagging, filtering
2. Implement playlist management UI/logic

### C. Clip Engine
1. Write tests for time slicing, randomization, music/video assignment
2. Implement slicing/randomizer logic

### D. Playback UI
1. Write tests for controls, sync logic, state transitions
2. Implement playback screen/controls

### E. Transcript System
1. Write tests for fetching, caching, syncing, editing
2. Implement transcript fetcher/viewer/editor

### F. Note-Taking System
1. Write tests for note creation, linking, tagging, editing, exporting
2. Implement note editor/storage

### G. Bookmark System
1. Write tests for adding, labeling, jumping to bookmarks
2. Implement bookmark manager/UI

### H. Tag System
1. Write tests for tag CRUD, application, filtering
2. Implement tag management

### I. Analytics Engine
1. Write tests for metrics collection, aggregation, reporting
2. Implement analytics dashboard/logic

### J. Settings & Customization
1. Write tests for settings persistence, theme, export
2. Implement settings screens/logic

## 4. E2E Testing
- After each major feature, write Detox E2E tests for user flows:
  - Onboarding, playlist creation, playback, note-taking, tag filtering, analytics, settings, export

## 5. Iteration & Refactoring
- Refactor regularly, always with a green test suite
- Add regression tests for bugs

## 6. MVP Milestones
1. Data models & storage
2. Playlist management
3. Clip engine & playback UI
4. Note-taking & transcript
5. Bookmarks, tags, analytics, settings
6. E2E flows for major user stories

## 7. How TDD Will Be Achieved
- Tests written before code for every module/component
- CI pipeline fails if tests do not pass
- No code merged without passing tests
- E2E tests ensure integration and UX stability

## 8. Documentation
- Document modules, test cases, user flows
- Maintain changelog and coverage reports
