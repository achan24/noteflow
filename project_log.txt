# NoteFlow Project Log

## [2025-04-25] Initial Game Plan and Next Steps

### Game Plan
- Architecture and requirements have been defined and documented in `architecture.txt` and `requirements_.txt`.
- The project will be developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD), as outlined in `TDD.txt`.
- The stack: React Native, SQLite/Realm, minimal dependencies, local-first, privacy-focused.

### Next Steps
1. Scaffold the React Native project and set up TypeScript.
2. Add and configure Jest, React Native Testing Library, and Detox for TDD.
3. Set up CI to run tests on every push.
4. Begin with core data models (Video, MusicTrack, Slice, Note, Bookmark, Tag, Transcript, Analytics):
    - Write tests for creation, validation, and CRUD.
    - Implement storage layer and ensure all tests pass.
5. Log all major milestones, decisions, and issues in this file as development progresses.

## [2025-04-25] Storage Layer Unit Testing with Mocks

### Milestone
- Configured Jest to mock expo-sqlite for storage logic tests.
- Created a realistic mock for expo-sqlite that simulates CRUD operations on an in-memory array.
- All storage logic/unit tests now pass in Jest, verifying correct usage of the SQLite API and app logic.

### Decisions
- Chose mocking for expo-sqlite to enable fast, reliable logic testing in CI and local dev, since full SQLite integration/E2E tests are not currently feasible.
- Will supplement with device or cloud-based integration testing before release.

### Next Steps
- Expand unit tests for edge cases and error handling in the storage/model layer.
- Add more business logic tests for other models.
- Consider periodic manual or cloud-based integration tests for real SQLite/device coverage.
