# NoteFlow Project Log

## [2025-04-25] Initial Game Plan and Next Steps

### Game Plan
- Architecture and requirements have been defined and documented in `architecture.txt` and `requirements_.txt`.
- The project will be developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD), as outlined in `TDD.txt`.
- The stack: React Native, SQLite/Realm, minimal dependencies, local-first, privacy-focused.

### Next Steps
1. Scaffold the React Native project and set up TypeScript.
2. Add and configure Jest, React Native Testing Library, and Detox for TDD.
3. Set up CI to run tests on every push.
4. Begin with core data models (Video, MusicTrack, Slice, Note, Bookmark, Tag, Transcript, Analytics):
    - Write tests for creation, validation, and CRUD.
    - Implement storage layer and ensure all tests pass.
5. Log all major milestones, decisions, and issues in this file as development progresses.
